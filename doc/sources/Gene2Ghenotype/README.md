# Gene2Phenotype

G2P is a publicly-accessible online system designed to facilitate the development, validation, curation and distribution of large-scale, evidence-based datasets for use in diagnostic variant filtering. Each G2P entry associates an allelic requirement and a mutational consequence at a defined locus with a disease entity. A confidence level and evidence link are assigned to each entry.
